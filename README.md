# User control panel for PR-RP
I have decided to step down as an UCP developer for the PR-RP staff team, and I'm no longer going to contribute to the community, as I feel betrayed due to recent conflicts and events within staff. This project is one hundred percent mine and I have full rights to do whatever I wish with it, so I have decided to release it to the public. I would say the project was 40% complete before I decided to shut it down, so please keep in mind that there are existing bugs and whatnot.

You may feel free to continue the project if you wish, as I'm officially done developing this UCP. The database will remain private though, as it contains sensitive information. I hope you enjoy and good luck!
